##REFLECTION

What aspect of this exercise did you find most interesting?
Integration with Rapid api was interesting along i like to find tech info and bands its responding
like architecting this simple service API 

â€¢ What did you find most cumbersome?
I was not able to finish unit tesing part as have limited time in hand.
i could have done lot better error handling for application cumbersome part i think 
also finding alternative for fonoapi is cumbersome part but i have used rapid api in past to was known to this info.


Rapid APi is used to fetch device specs as fonoapi is not working

here is sample key to use : 7225d0c5a7msh350259fc2093b22p1ce3eajsn3d5a2c1ea0ad

## Run the System
We can easily run the whole with only a single command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker will pull the MySQL and java images (if our machine does not have it before).

The services can be run on the background with command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop the System
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you need to stop and remove all containers, networks, and all images used by any service in <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, use the command:
```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all

```
